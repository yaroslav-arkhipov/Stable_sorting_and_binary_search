Description

A program for sorting arrays of arbitrary length with integers. Sorting can be done with 6 different sorting algorithms. Only stable algorithms are used. Then, in a sorted array, a given number is searched by a binary search algorithm.


The project was created on RAD Studio Delphi 10.3 Rio. You can also copy the code from the project to your project and it will work. No additional third-party libraries are required.
